# Data-Sources-of-CCUS-Research
Summary of data source and tracking of updates, about CCS/CCU (CCUS), CO2 Sources, CO2 Capture, CO2 Transport, CO2 Storage and CO2 Utilization.
Reliable data sources are the basic for system engineering research. I summarized the main data sources of my current research work and welcome to discuss with me, if you also work in this field or feel interested about CCUS research.
## CO2 Sources
- [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/)
## CO2 Capture
- [CEMCAP Project]
## CO2 Transport
- [FECM/NETL CO2 Transport Cost Model (2022)](https://netl.doe.gov/energy-analysis/search?search=CO2TransportCostModel)
## CO2 Storage


## CO2 Utilization


## International Institutions & Reports
