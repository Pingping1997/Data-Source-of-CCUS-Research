# Data-Sources-of-CCUS-Research
- Summary of data source and tracking of updates, about CCS/CCU (CCUS, Carbon capture, storage/utilization), CO2 Sources, CO2 Capture, CO2 Transport, CO2 Storage and CO2 Utilization.
- Reliable data sources are the basic for system engineering research. 
- I summarize the main data sources of during research work and will keep update it along my progress.
- If you also work in this field or feel interested about CCUS research, welcome to discuss or contact with me (pingping.wang@tuwien.ac.at)!
